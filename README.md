Background Information
=========================
This is an example of a larger project I did for my distributed systems course that demonstrates socket programming, multi-threading, and a little SQL using H2. Its primary function was to take in student records pass them to another thread to process them, then pass them to yet another thread to put them into the database. Note the example image for this application isn't too fancy, it's simply showing that between each UNIX terminal they're passing information and processing student records.
